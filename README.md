BBPrototype
===========

Sencha touch 2 (ST2) prototype developed on Barcelona Betabeers.

The project is organized using tags. Each tag is representing the step of the demo prototype.

You can view a short description of each tag below:

1) First_step

It represents a basic ST2 application, with loading screen and Main view.

2) Adding slider_menu

In this step, I've added slider_menu downloaded from (http://github.com/wozznik/Slider-Menu). For more information to add a Slider-menu into your application, read Slider-Menu README file!

3) Adding style

In this step, I've added a new style for Slider menu using SASS. We learn about, how ST2 is using 
SASS and how we can theming our ST2 Applications

4) Add Buttons panel

In this step, I've added buttons panel to show how you can use buttons and I've added some event listeners on controller, to catch button events.
